# calculator
Class assignment was to make a calculator. I had the most fun in the design aspect of it using CSS.
The rounded buttons were made using a bunch of shadow CSS.
Background picture used was from: http://subtlepatterns.com/

Future goals:
Right now the calculator still seems like pieces cobbled together.
I'd like to focus on making it seem more like a unified object.
